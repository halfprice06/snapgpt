# SnapGPT üì∏

SnapGPT is a command-line utility that creates a single, well-organized snapshot of your codebase. It's especially handy for sharing your project context with AI coding assistants (like ChatGPT) while keeping your code local. By default, SnapGPT automatically opens the snapshotted code file in **Cursor**, so that on the ChatGPT Desktop app your code repository is "autofocused" and you can start asking ChatGPT questions right away‚Äîno copy and pasting required. You can configure it to open in other editors as well (VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, Xcode).

SnapGPT offers two modes:

* **Incremental Mode** (Default): A snapshot of your codebase is created when you run 'snapgpt' in the terminal. 

* **Watch Mode**: Automatically updates your snapshot as you code‚Äîgreat for active development sessions with AI assistance

For example:
```bash
snapgpt watch
```

In either mode, SnapGPT crawls through your directories, gathers all relevant code files (based on your config and preferences), and concatenates them into one text file for easy reading or chat-pasting.

## Installation üöÄ

### macOS (Recommended)

Using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install halfprice06/homebrew-tap-snapgpt/snapgpt
```

Using pipx (recommended for Python CLI tools):
```bash
# Install pipx if you haven't already
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Install snapgpt
pipx install snapgpt
```

### Other Methods:

Using pip:
```bash
pip install --user snapgpt
```

Using a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install snapgpt
```

After install, simply run in the repo or directory you want to snapshot:
```bash
snapgpt
```

By default, SnapGPT will:
1. Recursively scan the current directory (`.`).
2. Exclude folders such as __pycache__, .git, node_modules, etc.
3. Include files with extensions like .py, .js, .md, .json, and more.
4. Save everything to full_code_snapshot.txt.
5. Open that file in your chosen editor.
6. Copy the content to your clipboard (if enabled).

You will see:
1. A directory tree at the top of full_code_snapshot.txt.
2. Followed by the full text of every included file, separated by headers indicating file paths.

## Usage üìù

```bash
snapgpt [options]
```

SnapGPT offers two main modes of operation:

1. Default (Incremental) Mode:
```bash
snapgpt
```
Creates a snapshot of your codebase, using incremental scanning to only re-read changed files. This makes repeated snapshots much faster, especially for large codebases.

2. Watch Mode:
```bash
snapgpt watch
```
Continuously monitors your codebase and updates the snapshot whenever files change. (See Watch Mode Details for more info.)

## Watch Mode Details

Watch Mode uses the watchdog library to watch your project folder in real-time. When you run:

```bash
snapgpt watch
```

SnapGPT will:
1. Perform an initial incremental snapshot of your code (creating or updating full_code_snapshot.txt).
2. Stay running in the terminal, listening for filesystem changes (adds, edits, deletes).
3. Update full_code_snapshot.txt automatically whenever you modify a file that's tracked by SnapGPT.

Press Ctrl+C to stop watching.

If you need to run SnapGPT in the background, consider using tools like tmux, screen, or your system's background job features, but typically watch mode is run in a dedicated terminal window.

### Performance & Debouncing

SnapGPT "debounces" change events with a short delay (about 1 second by default) to avoid regenerating the snapshot multiple times if a file is changing rapidly. Each time you save a file, SnapGPT will wait one second after the last change before regenerating the snapshot.

### Stopping Watch Mode

Simply press Ctrl+C in the terminal to end the watch process. SnapGPT will print a message indicating the watcher is stopping, and then the process will exit.

## Common Options üõ†Ô∏è

| Option / Flag | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| -d, --directories | List of directories to scan (default: .) |
| -f, --files | List of specific files to include (overrides directory scanning) |
| -o, --output | Output file path (default: full_code_snapshot.txt) |
| -e, --extensions | File extensions to include (e.g. -e .py .js .md) |
| --exclude-dirs | Directories to exclude from scanning |
| --max-size | Maximum file size in MB to include (0 for no limit) |
| --max-depth | Maximum directory depth to traverse (0 for no limit) |
| -q, --quiet | Suppress progress and non-error messages |
| --no-copy | Do not copy the snapshot to clipboard |
| --set-default-editor | Set the default editor globally |
| --set-default-extensions | Set the default file extensions globally |
| --set-default-exclude-dirs | Set the default excluded directories globally |

## Example Commands üí°

1. Include specific files only:
```bash
snapgpt -f src/main.py tests/test_main.py README.md
```

2. Scan only the src and lib directories, exclude dist:
```bash
snapgpt -d src lib --exclude-dirs dist
```

3. Set default editor to VS Code, then quit immediately:
```bash
snapgpt --set-default-editor code
```

4. Use a max file size limit of 1 MB and a max depth of 5 subdirectories:
```bash
snapgpt --max-size 1 --max-depth 5
```

5. Watch mode with custom output file:
```bash
snapgpt watch -d . --output live_snapshot.txt
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

SnapGPT reads configuration from `~/.config/snapgpt/config.json`, which is created during first-time setup or with defaults if you skip the setup.

Example config:
```json
{
  "default_editor": "cursor",
  "auto_copy_to_clipboard": true,
  "first_time_setup_done": true,
  "file_extensions": [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".md", ".json"],
  "exclude_dirs": ["__pycache__", ".git", "node_modules", "build"]
}
```

You can update these values:
- Using command-line flags like --set-default-editor and --no-copy
- By directly editing the config file
