# SnapGPT

SnapGPT is a command-line utility that creates a single, well-organized snapshot of your codebase. It's especially handy for sharing your project context with AI coding assistants (like ChatGPT) while keeping your code local. By default, SnapGPT automatically opens the snapshotted code file in **Cursor**, so that on the ChatGPT Desktop app your code repository is "autofocused" and you can start asking ChatGPT questions right away—no copy and pasting required. You can configure it to open in other editors as well (VS Code, Windsurfer, or any other editor).

SnapGPT crawls through your directories, gathers all relevant code files (based on your config and preferences), and concatenates them into one text file for easy reading or chat-pasting.

## Features
* Collect code from multiple directories into a single output file
* Automatically exclude certain directories (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.git`, `node_modules`)
* Configurable file extensions (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.tsx`) so you can include exactly what you want
* **Auto-open the snapshot** in an editor of your choice (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurfer, or fallback to your system default)
* Lightweight and has minimal dependencies (primarily `termcolor`)
* **Local only**: SnapGPT does not make any network calls, keeping your code fully private

## Installation

### macOS (Recommended)

Using **Homebrew**:
```bash
brew install halfprice06/homebrew-tap-snapgpt/snapgpt

Using pipx (recommended for Python CLI tools):

# Install pipx if you haven't already
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Install snapgpt
pipx install snapgpt

Other Methods

Using pip:

pip install --user snapgpt

Using a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install snapgpt

SnapGPT requires Python 3.7+.
It is tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Quick Start

From your project directory, simply run:

snapgpt

By default, SnapGPT will:
	1.	Recursively scan the current directory (.)
	2.	Exclude folders such as __pycache__, .git, node_modules, etc.
	3.	Include files with extensions like .py, .js, .md, .json, and more
	4.	Save everything to full_code_snapshot.txt
	5.	Open that file in your default editor (configured in ~/.config/snapgpt/config.json)

You will see:
	1.	A directory tree at the top of full_code_snapshot.txt
	2.	Followed by the full text of every included file, separated by headers indicating file paths

This single file is perfect for sharing with ChatGPT or any other AI coding assistant (or just for your own review)!

Usage

snapgpt [options]

Common Options

Option / Flag	Description
-d, --directories	List of directories to scan (default: .)
-o, --output	Output file path (default: full_code_snapshot.txt)
-e, --extensions	File extensions to include (e.g. -e .py .js .md)
--exclude-dirs	Directories to exclude from scanning (e.g. --exclude-dirs .git node_modules dist)
--no-open	Do not automatically open the snapshot after creation
--editor {cursor,code,windsurfer}	Editor to open the snapshot in (overrides your default config)
--set-default-editor	Set the default editor globally, then exit (e.g. snapgpt --set-default-editor code)
--set-default-extensions	Set the default file extensions globally, then exit (e.g. snapgpt --set-default-extensions .py .md)
--set-default-exclude-dirs	Set the default excluded directories globally, then exit
--max-size	Maximum file size in MB to include (0 for no limit)
--max-depth	Maximum directory depth to traverse (0 for no limit)
-q, --quiet	Suppress progress and non-error messages

Example Commands
	1.	Scan only the src and lib directories, exclude dist:

snapgpt -d src lib --exclude-dirs dist


	2.	Include only Python and Markdown files, and skip opening:

snapgpt --extensions .py .md --no-open


	3.	Set default editor to VS Code, then quit immediately:

snapgpt --set-default-editor code


	4.	Use a max file size limit of 1 MB (1,000,000 bytes) and a max depth of 5 subdirectories:

snapgpt --max-size 1 --max-depth 5

Configuration

SnapGPT reads configuration from ~/.config/snapgpt/config.json, which is auto-created with defaults the first time you run SnapGPT.

Example config (simplified):

{
  "default_editor": "cursor",
  "file_extensions": [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".md", ".json"],
  "exclude_dirs": ["__pycache__", ".git", "node_modules", "build"]
}

You can update these values persistently using:
	•	snapgpt --set-default-editor [cursor|code|windsurfer]
	•	snapgpt --set-default-extensions .py .js .md
	•	snapgpt --set-default-exclude-dirs .git node_modules build

Privacy and Security
	•	Local Only: SnapGPT does not send your code to any external server or service. It simply reads files from your disk and consolidates them into a single text file.
	•	Editor Launch: If you choose to open the snapshot automatically, SnapGPT will launch your local editor. No additional code upload or syncing occurs.

Troubleshooting
	1.	Command Not Found
Make sure you installed SnapGPT in a directory on your PATH. Try:

pip show snapgpt

If it’s not in your PATH, you may need to use python -m snapgpt ... or add the script’s location to your PATH.

	2.	Permission Denied
On some systems, certain directories may be locked down. SnapGPT will skip unreadable directories and display a warning.
	3.	No Files Found
If your project has unusual file extensions, add them with --extensions .mjs .hbs or via the default config.
	4.	Editor Not Opening
Confirm your chosen editor (Cursor, VS Code, or Windsurfer) is installed and accessible from the command line. On Windows, SnapGPT will attempt various fallback methods if cursor is your default editor but not found in your PATH.
